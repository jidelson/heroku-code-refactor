                        <p>
                        I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Prior to coding, I recieved my Bachelor's in Applied Science for Animation 
                        and Visual Effects. I am hard working and passionate about my work. I am always looking for ways to improve. I 
                        graduated from Lambda School, a nine month intensive boot-camp style school, where I was taught the most contemporary
                        techniques and skills for web development. When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, and 
                        working on a variety of art projects.
